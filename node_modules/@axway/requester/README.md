## Changes

#### 2.0.0-0
- #4919: Requester now is just a tiny wrapper around the request module. It has no business logic within it. 

- #4918: Breaking change: Previously, if a request to a method which documented an optional query parameter with a default value and was not supplied to the request, the default value would be sent to the service instead. Now, default values are not used when sending query parameters.

- #4918: Breaking change: Removed support for the following credential configuration values. Authorization parameters should be provided in authorizationData instead:

	- `x-vendor-openapi-username`
	- `x-vendor-openapi-password`
	- `x-vendor-openapi-key`
	- `x-vendor-openapi-token`

- #4918: Added support for authorization parameters, replacing `x-vendor-openapi-` global configuration. These parameters are generated based on the `security` parameter in the original swagger document.

#### 1.1.2
- #4757: Changed SCM repository and associated internal cleanup.
